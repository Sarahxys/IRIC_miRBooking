# IRIC_miRBooking
This is created to document the commands that I used for my summer internship in Dr. Major's lab, IRIC. This project focus on examining RNA leader and follower using miRBooking. 

Project objective:
1. identify leader and follower of genes in Jordan's experiment by munipulating gene expression level with miRBooking and examining silencing factors. (maybe using Zohra's scripts if any)
