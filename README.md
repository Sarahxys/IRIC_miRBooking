# IRIC_miRBooking
This is created to document the commands that I used for my summer internship in Dr. Major's lab, IRIC. This project focus on examining RNA leader and follower using miRBooking. 

Project objectives:
1. Identifying leaders and followers of genes in Jordan's hypoxia experiment by munipulating gene expression levels with miRBooking and examining silencing powers. (maybe using Zohra's scripts if any)
